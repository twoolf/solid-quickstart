   <p  ALIGN=LEFT> Your use of the Daily24 App and your participation in the study are each voluntary. By using the Daily24 App or participating in the Study, you consent to the privacy practices described in this privacy policy. The entity responsible for the collection and processing of your personal data in the context of the Study is Johns Hopkins University ("JHU"), School of Medicine, 725 Wolfe St., Baltimore, MD 21215 USA.</p>

<h3>Information We Collect</h3>
   <p  ALIGN=LEFT>In addition to the data we collect in registration for the Study, we collect the following through the Daily24 App and the Study:</p>

   <ul>
      <li><i>Data Imports:</i> &nbsp;  The Daily24 App enables you to import data into the cloud-based backend for the study, data defined in connection with your daily activity. You may also give permission to import certain data from third party wearable activity devices (like Fitbit or Jawbone), as well as other data that you may have provided separately or that may be available through other third party applications and data available through Health app, such as weight, height, steps walked or sleep pattern. We are not responsible for the data practices of third parties from which you may elect to import data and you are advised to consult their privacy policies separately. You may choose not to import these data types and to still participate in the Study.</li>
      <li><i>Standard Log Information:</i> &nbsp;  We automatically collect standard server log information, such as internet protocol address and details of how you used the Metabolic Compass App (e.g. history of page requests such as uploading data or signing in and date/time of request).    </li>
      <li><i>Fabric (Crashlytics and Answers): </i>To improve the user experience we track which user interface components you access through the Metabolic Compass App.  We also track crash stack traces as part of our debugging and quality assurance process.</li>
    </ul>

<h3>How We Use Information</h3>
   <p  ALIGN=LEFT>We use your contact information, including email address, to contact you for administrative purposes regarding your participation in the Study and your use of the Daily24 App. </p>

   <p  ALIGN=LEFT>We use the information that we collect through the Daily24 App and the Study to operate, maintain, enhance and provide all features of the Daily24 App and the Study, to provide services and information that you request, to respond to comments and questions and otherwise to provide support to users. </p>

   <p  ALIGN=LEFT>Your data will be used for improving general health, medical and fitness management and for the purposes of medical research. Your data will NOT be used for advertising or other use-based data mining purposes. We will not access your personal contacts, other applications, personal photos nor text and email messages on your iPhone. </p>

   <p  ALIGN=LEFT>With regard to our processing of personal data for the Study, our Daily24 App and the necessary ancillary services aggregate user-provided and user-generated information, including personal data. We separate your account information (e.g., name or email address) from your Study data (including health information such as height, body weight, blood pressures, heart rates) and combine your coded Study data (without your name) with those of other Study participants for research and analysis as described below under “How We Disclose Information.” </p>

   <p  ALIGN=LEFT>We use standard log files and other automatically-collected usage data that is essential for the Study and the Daily24 App to function effectively, including to: (i) personalize the Metabolic Compass App and the Study, such as by remembering information so that it does not need to be re-entered; (ii) monitor and analyze the Metabolic Compass App and the Study; (iii) monitor aggregate Metabolic Compass App usage metrics; and (iv) track your activities on the Metabolic Compass App and in the Study. We do not use cookies, beacons or device fingerprinting.</p>

<h3>How We Disclose Information</h3>
  <p  ALIGN=LEFT> Except as described in this privacy policy, we will not sell, rent, lease, give away, disclose or share your contact information, and will not disclose your information that we collect through the Metabolic Compass App and the Study to third parties without your consent. We may provide contact or coded study information to third parties if you consent to us doing so, as well as in the following circumstances:</p>
   <ul>
      <li>When we work with third parties who provide services on our behalf, we take steps to limit the personal data provided to them to that which is reasonably necessary for them to perform their functions for the allowable purposes listed above. We require them by contract to agree to only process the personal data in accordance with our instructions and to maintain the security and confidentiality of such information by applying adequate technical and organizational measures. </li>
      <li>To the extent permitted by applicable law, we may disclose your information if required to do so by law to comply with state and federal laws, in response to a court order, judicial or other government subpoena or warrant, or to otherwise cooperate with law enforcement or other governmental agencies.</li>
      <li>We also reserve the right to disclose your information that we believe, in good faith, is appropriate or necessary to (i) take precautions against liability, (ii) protect ourselves or others from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful uses or activity, (iii) investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations, (iv) protect the security or integrity of the Metabolic Compass App and the Study and any facilities or equipment used to make the Metabolic Compass App or Study available, or (v) protect our property or other legal rights (including, but not limited to, enforcement of our agreements), or the rights, property, or safety of others. We will notify you of any such disclosures.</li>
      <li>Information about our users, including personal data, may be disclosed and otherwise transferred to an acquirer, successor, or assignee as part of any merger, acquisition, debt financing, sale of assets, or similar transaction, or in the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership in which information is transferred to one or more third parties as one of our business assets, to the extent and in the way as prescribed by applicable law.</li>
      <li>As described above in the “How We Use Information” section, we will combine your Study data, including survey response and tasks measurements, with those of other Study participants. The combined data will be transferred to our cloud based backend, a computational research platform, for analysis. Researchers from the Study team and its partners accessing data through the backend will analyze the data and report findings back through our blog and scientific publications. This Study is set up to share your coded Study data with other researchers worldwide to benefit future scientific research. If you choose to participate, your coded data (without your contact information) will be added to a shared Study dataset and will be made available to qualified researchers who are registered researchers and who agree to using the data in an ethical manner, to do no harm and to not attempt to re-identify or re-contact you unless you have chosen to allow them to do so.</li>
   </ul>

  <p  ALIGN=LEFT>You have the option to share data from your mobile device‘s iOS Health app with the App. Unless you agree to share your data through and with the App, you will not be able to include it in the study.

We cannot, however, fully guarantee the security of personal data or other information transmitted to us through the Metabolic Compass App or the Study.</p>

  <p  ALIGN=LEFT>We take steps to ensure that your personal data is kept in de-identified format by removing personal data that reasonably can be used to identify you directly, such as name or e-mail address, from the research study data.

Total anonymity cannot be guaranteed.</p>

  <p  ALIGN=LEFT>Within the App, you are able to review and amend certain personal data we have collected through your use of the Daily24 App and participation in the Study.</p>

  <p  ALIGN=LEFT>If you wish to access, rectify, delete or block any other personal data we hold about you, you may contact us at tom@daiware.io Please note that while any changes you make will be reflected in active user databases within a reasonable period of time, we may retain all information you submit for backups, archiving, prevention of fraud and abuse, analytics, satisfaction of legal obligations, or where we otherwise reasonably believe that we have a legitimate reason to do so, as permitted by applicable law.</p>
